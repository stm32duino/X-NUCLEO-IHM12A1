# X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1

The X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1 is a low voltage dual brush DC motor driver expansion board based on the
STSPIN240 for STM32 Nucleo. It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for the implementation
of portable motor driving applications such as thermal printers, robotics and toys.
Thanks to its programmable current limiter and complete set of protection features,
it offers high levels of performance and robustness. The X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1 is compatible with the
Arduino UNO R3 connector and most STM32 Nucleo boards.

## Examples

There is 1 example with the X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1 library.
* X_NUCLEO_IHM12A1_HelloWorld: This application provides a simple example of usage of the X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1 
Dual Brush DC Motor Driver Expansion Board. It shows how to use two brush DC motors connected to the board,
moving the rotors with several speed values, direction of rotations, etc.
